/**
 * Simulated application code exercised by the example experiments and tests.
 *
 * <p>This package plays the role of <b>the application under test</b>. In a real
 * project, these classes would live in {@code src/main/java} — LLM clients,
 * payment gateways, domain models, validators. Here they are simulated so the
 * examples can run without external dependencies while still exhibiting the
 * non-deterministic behaviour that motivates probabilistic testing.
 *
 * <h2>Relationship to the rest of the examples</h2>

 *       app (this)      ← application code (no PUnit dependency)

 *   <li>{@code payment/} — Payment gateway simulating real-world reliability
 *       patterns</li>
 *   <li>{@code shopping/} — Domain model for shopping basket operations
