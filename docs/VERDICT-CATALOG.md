# Verdict Catalog

A curated collection of archetypal PUnit verdicts, organized from simplest to most complex.

PUnit verdicts are available at two detail levels:

- **Summary** (default) — compact verdict with pass rate comparison, termination reason, and caveats
- **Verbose** (`-Dpunit.stats.detail=VERBOSE`) — full statistical analysis including hypothesis test formulation, confidence intervals, and inference workings

The numerical values shown below come from actual test runs and will vary between executions due to the probabilistic nature of the tests.

---

## 1. Pass

The simplest passing verdict. PUnit detects that the required number of successes has been reached and terminates early, skipping the remaining samples.

## 2. Fail with early termination

When PUnit determines that the threshold can no longer be reached — even if every remaining sample succeeds — it terminates early and reports the impossibility analysis.

## 4. Budget exhaustion

When a cost budget (time or tokens) runs out before all samples complete, PUnit reports how many samples were executed and the pass rate at termination. The default budget-exhaustion behaviour is FAIL — the test fails regardless of the partial results.

An alternative budget behaviour, `EVALUATE_PARTIAL`, evaluates the partial results against the threshold as if the test had completed normally. This can produce either a pass or fail depending on the partial results.

## 5. SLA compliance with contract provenance

When a threshold originates from an SLA, SLO, or policy, PUnit frames the hypothesis test accordingly and includes a THRESHOLD PROVENANCE section tracing the threshold back to its source. The hypothesis text adapts to the threshold origin (e.g. "system meets SLA requirement" vs "system meets SLO target" vs "system meets policy requirement").

## 6. Compliance undersized

When the sample size is too small to provide meaningful statistical evidence of compliance with a high-reliability SLA target, PUnit warns that a passing result is only a smoke-test-level observation. A failing result remains a reliable indication of non-conformance.

## 7. Covariate misalignment

When the test runs under conditions that differ from the baseline (e.g. different time of day, weekday vs weekend), PUnit emits a BASELINE FOUND banner listing the misaligned covariates before the test runs. This also appears as a caveat in the verdict.

> **Not yet available.** This section requires blocks that were not produced by the current test run. Missing: temporalMismatchShowsCaveatTransparent (BASELINE_FOUND, SUMMARY), temporalMismatchShowsCaveatTransparent (TEST_CONFIGURATION, SUMMARY), temporalMismatchShowsCaveatTransparent (STATISTICAL_ANALYSIS, SUMMARY), temporalMismatchShowsCaveatTransparent (STATISTICAL_ANALYSIS, VERBOSE)

---

## 8. Intent-governed verdicts (VERIFICATION vs SMOKE)

PUnit supports two test intents: **VERIFICATION** (evidential — enforces a statistical feasibility gate before any samples execute) and **SMOKE** (sentinel — permits undersized configurations and uses softened language). The intent appears in the verdict banner and influences hypothesis framing and caveats.

VERIFICATION is the default intent.

A VERIFICATION test with insufficient samples will fail at configuration time (not shown here — see the user guide for the infeasibility message). The examples below show how intent affects the verdict for tests that *do* execute.

When a test is configured with `intent = SMOKE` and a normative threshold origin (SLA, SLO, or POLICY), PUnit uses softened language — "consistent with the target" rather than "meets SLA requirement". If the sample is undersized for verification, a sizing note appears.

If the SMOKE sample is already large enough for verification, PUnit suggests upgrading to `intent = VERIFICATION` for evidential strength.
